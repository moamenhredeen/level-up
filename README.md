- start contributing to illumos

### create markup language

- markdown very limited and there is not standard
- org is emacs only, but i do think that emacs is good markup language. maybe
  the langauge should be based on the org
- asciidoc: is weired syntax expicially for tables
- restructuredText: complex
- Roff: is like reading a binary file
- typst: i really like typ syntax, but it's more of a scripting language than
  markup language. maybe i can take the markup parts of typst
- i should compare the existing markup language before desiging the language
  based on different criteria
- build parser that can be used as a library for the language
- build treesitter parser (for easy integration with vim, emacs, vscode, ...)
- build neovim plugin for the languae
