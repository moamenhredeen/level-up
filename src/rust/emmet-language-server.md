# Emmet Language Server
I'm currently learning Rust and as you all now the best to learn a language, is to build something with it. 
I did not want to start building something complex, because this can prevent me from focusing on the rust language it self.
For this reason i choose to build a language server for emmet.

## Background

## Emmet
from their site
> Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow

emmet works like code snippets for HTML and CSS, but it is way more powerfull than traditional code snippets.

## Language Server
A Language Server is a server designed to provide language-specific features such as auto-completion, error-checking, and code formatting to code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

The concept of a Language Server is based on the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP), which was originally developed by Microsoft.
